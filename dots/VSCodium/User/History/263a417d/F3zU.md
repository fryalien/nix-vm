Thanks!
My recording/editing setup is OBS + Kdenlive,
and my rice is mainly Hyprland + Stylix.
The fonts are Intel One Mono.
I'll definietly get around to making videos on my recording setup and my whole config someday though :)
Here are links to my config if you're curious: https://gitlab.com/librephoenix/nixos-config or https://github.com/librephoenix/nixos-config
